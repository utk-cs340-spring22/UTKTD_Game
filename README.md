### Project Description

### Table of Contents (optional)

### How to Install
In the main GitHub repository you will find a folder titled UTKTD_Game. In order to run the game, you must download this folder and run the .exe inside titled "UTKTD.exe". That's it. Once the game is running, you'll be brought to the main menu, and from there you can start the game.

### How to Play
Once the game is running, waves begin spawning every 5 seconds. As the game progresses, waves get progressively harder (enemies get more health as the game goes on). In order to defend your base, you must begin placing turrets on the square nodes around the map. Keep in mind the turrets have different ranges, so the turrets must be placed close to the path the enemies will take in order to be effective.

The shop is located along the bottom of the screen. There are three different types of turrets: standard, missile launcher, and laser beamer. Each has a different cost and different abilities. The standard turret simply shoots bullets at enemies, dealing damage. The missile launcher shoots more slowly, but deals splash damage and slows enemies it hits for a short time. Lastly, the laser beamer locks onto one target within its range, and the longer the beam is targeting an enemy, the more damage it deals.

Once a turret is placed on the map, you can open its menu by clicking it. On the left side of the menu, you can upgrade turrets. Each successive upgrade costs more money than the last, and each turret is capped at 5 upgrades. In this menu you can also sell turrets, for a price of half of the total money invested into it. So, the more a turret is upgraded, the more it will sell for. To close this menu, either sell the turret or click the turret again.

The game continues until you run out of lives. There is no other end to the game. The point is to play for a high score. Good luck!
